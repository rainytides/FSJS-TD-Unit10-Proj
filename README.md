## Full Stack React and REST API Project

This project is a full-stack web application built using React for the frontend and Express for the backend REST API.

## Features

- Express backend providing REST API for user and course data.
- CORS enabled for cross-origin requests between client and server.

2. Install dependencies:
   - For API: `cd api` then `npm install`
   - For Client: `cd client` then `npm install`
3. Run both applications:
